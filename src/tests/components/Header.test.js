  // ENZYME SETUP EXAMPLE
  // expect(toJSON(wrapper)).toMatchSnapshot();// using this with enzyme now adds a bunch of enzyme scripot into the snapshot, which we don't want because if the enzyme script changes, it will say the snapshot doesn't match, even if what we actually rendered didn't change. Thus, we need to add a library called enzyme-to-json and use it when we are expecting something about our enzyme wrapper
  // ^ with enzyme, need to throw toJSON around the wrapper, and it will extract the meaningful info, and disregard the enzyme content
  // ^you can also wire this up in the jest.config.json filt to run automatically so you don't have to import it or call it
  // ^ you do this by adding:
  // "snapshotSerializers": [
  //   "enzyme-to-json/serializer"
  // ]
  // to the setup file, before or after the "setupFiles" key and then you can run the file as it is written below without importing
